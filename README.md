# Educated-Veganism

## Description 

Veganism is a growing trend in the United States. Despite its growing popularity, many resources regarding veganism are extreme, biased and factually incorrect. It can be difficult to find credible information regarding veganism. This web application is a library of vegan resources which are categorized into the different questions one might have regarding veganism. What is veganism? Why consider a plant based lifestyle? How does one live a plant based life? The web application is intentionally left private to allow the user to explore veganism without the judgement from the internet.
