                    The Internet is known for misinformation that can range from satirical to harmful. When it comes to veganism, the internet is no different.
                    From sensational headlines of parents contributing to their childâ€™s untimely death through vegan diets to exaggerated claims of major organizations such as PETA.
                    There is no shortage of misinformation regarding a plant based lifestyle.
